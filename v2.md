# Changelog - V2

## External API

* Redesigned the core engine completely:
  * Changed the shoddy and absolute abomination of an awaiter (`WaitForSeconds()`) to a much better `Wait()`. This will correctly pause engine code execution without blocking the thread completely, because this time I had more than two weeks to work on this :)
    * To cancel a Wait, use `CancelWait()`.


* Redesigned gameObjects; they are now approriately called `Entities`:
  * Entities are now their class, and can be used as such. In order to properly use an entity, they need to be registered via `Entities.Register()`.
  * `Entities` object can be used to Register, Find, FindAllTagged, and Destroy entities.
  * Their coordinate is now actually their center point, rather than their top-left corner.
  * Entities are currently restricted to rectangular shapes.
    * `Vertices` can be used to get the corners of the triangle.
  * Much like previous versions, they support tags, which can be used to filter lookups via `Entities.FindAllTagged()`.
  * Sprites can be directly passed onto them, keeping a separate instance.
  * They have various new built in functions:
    * `Translate` : Moves the entity by a given amount of pixels per frame (use with DeltaTime to scale).
    * `MoveTowards` : Moves the entity towards a given point by a set amount of steps per frame (use with DeltaTime to scale).
    * `GetCollisionsByTag` : Gets the list of entities this one is colliding with based on their tags.
* Redesigned the entire sprite system, much like the Entity system:
  * `Sprite`
    * Spritesheet tiles and hex-colours can be mixed in the `contents` field. These sub-sprites will be rendered on the given `Entity` in chunks. (e.g.: if there are 6 sub-sprites, with a tilesize of 10, on a 50 by 40 entity, every row will be filled with the first 5 sub-sprites, repeating over 4 rows.)
    * If numbers are used as sub-sprites, the sprite needs to reference a `SpriteSheet`. This tells the renderer where to look for the rexture.
  * `AnimatedSprite`
    * Very similar to `Sprite`, however it has additional field such as `speed`, and `value`.
    * The `value` field shows the current sub-sprite (frame) displayed in the animation, which is repeated over the entire Entity.
    * The `speed` field is the update speed of the animation in ms.
  * `SpriteSheet`
    * Any number of spritesheets can be loaded, however they need to be registered in order to be used via `SpriteSheets.Register()`.
    * The image content is loaded on engine startup.
    * Upon loading, they are pre-indexed based on the given tilesize.
  * `SpriteSheets` object can be used to Register, Find spritesheets.
  * Animations are now independently controlled in terms of speed, however their update cycle has been tied to the main update cycle, they are dependent on the main loop, and are affected by changes to that. This causes a slight delay in sprite updates (max the amount of time between frames).
* Exposed the `deltaTime` function, which returns the time elapsed since the previous frame in either seconds (fraction).
* 


## Internal

* Redesigned internal execution loop, it is now much more accurate and powerful.
* Added a sprite preprocessor that should cut down calculations by a large chunk at virtually no cost. **Note**: The way rendering was done previously, the engine was recalculating the coordiates of every sprite segment every time it encountered it. This meant it was needlessly recalculating the exact same values, dozens of times per cycle. The calculations are relatively simple so they did not cause much performance issues, however the preprocessor allows for a lot of cool shortcuts in other parts of the rendering pipeline, which should be a rather big boost.
