# Changelog - V2

## External API

* Changed the shoddy and absolute abomination of an awaiter (`WaitForSeconds()`) to a much better `wait.set()`. This will correctly pause engine code execution without blocking the thread completely, because this time I had more than two weeks to work on this :)
* Redesigned gameObjects; they are now much more intuitive and pleasant to use:
gameObject creation and internal functions have been streamlined to make it more responsive. For example it now has built in error handling, and accessing gameObjects is now a chainable function, with all related functions tied under `gameObject.find()` return value.
* Redesigned sprites; they are also much better now, with proper animation handling, and the ability to mix hex-colours with sprites. They very closely resemble gameObjects in terms of usage.
* Animations are now independently controlled in terms of speed, however their update cycle has been tied to the main update cycle, they are dependent on the main loop, and are affected by changes to that.
* Exposed the `deltaTime` function, which returns the time elapsed since the previous frame in either seconds (`deltaTime.sec`) or milliseconds (`deltaTime.ms`).
* 


## Internal

* Redesigned internal execution loop, it is now much more accurate and powerful.
* Added a sprite preprocessor that should cut down calculations by a large chunk at virtually no cost. **Note**: The way rendering was done previously, the engine was recalculating the coordiates of every sprite segment every time it encountered it. This meant it was needlessly recalculating the exact same values, dozens of times per cycle. The calculations are relatively simple so they did not cause much performance issues, however the preprocessor allows for a lot of cool shortcuts in other parts of the rendering pipeline, which should be a rather big boost.
